# Let's Install Go!

Compared to scripting languages and others, Go is relatively easy to install. Go to the [getting started page](https://golang.org/doc/install) to complete your download.

>Many systems have package managers that can install Go. Many of these are out of date, are modified, or don't get updated regularly. I recommend that you use the installation instructions above and avoid package managers.

## Set Up your Editor

What's a programming language without a good IDE? There are several that do well with Go, but I'll focus on one of the most popular, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VS Code).

Installing this plugin is also fairly easy. Make sure that you have VS Code installed, and then click on the green "Install" button at the top of this page: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go. Your VS Code should open, install the plugin, and then it should start installing Go tools. Follow the instructions to install everything. You VS Code terminal should open and close a few times.

At the end, you'll see a message that says "You're ready to Go"
